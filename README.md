# About Dragverse
We are building to build the dragverse, a web app where fans can connect with others, post, mirror, and collect posts from drag creators and others in the community. Those who apply to become creators can live-stream their art and mint these videos as collectibles that their communities can collect for free, auctioned items, or at a set price. All thanks to recent blockchain technologies and protocols like Lense and Livepeer.

## About this Repo
After winning Next Video Build we wanted to set up a new repository. This time celebrating Marsha P. Johnson, an American gay liberation activist and self-identified drag queen.
